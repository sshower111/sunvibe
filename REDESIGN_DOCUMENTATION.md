- Maximum content width optimized at 1400px for better readability

### 2. **Enhanced Visual Hierarchy**

- Clear size differences between heading levels
- Better font weight distribution
- Refined letter spacing and line heights

### 3. **Professional Spacing System**
- Container padding: `px-8 lg:px-16` (increased from `px-6 lg:px-12`)
- Section spacing: `py-32 sm:py-40` (increased from `py-24 sm:py-32`)
- Card gaps: `gap-8 md:gap-10` (increased from `gap-6 md:gap-8`)
- Consistent use of larger increments (8px, 16px, 24px, 32px)

### 4. **Refined Interactions**
- Smoother, longer transitions (300ms-700ms)
- Subtle scale effects on hover
- Enhanced shadow depth
- Professional micro-animations

- Consistent padding patterns across components
- Better responsive scaling

### Typography Scale
```css
/* Heading Sizes */
h1: text-6xl to text-[7rem] (96px-112px)
h2: text-4xl to text-6xl (36px-60px)
h3: text-2xl to text-3xl (24px-30px)

/* Body Text */
Large: text-lg to text-xl (18px-20px)
Base: text-base to text-lg (16px-18px)

/* Letter Spacing */
Tight headings: tracking-[-0.03em] to tracking-[-0.02em]
Wide labels: tracking-[0.08em] to tracking-[0.12em]
```

### Color Usage
- Maintained existing color palette (warm browns/golds)
- Better use of opacity for hierarchy (`/80`, `/75`, `/70`, `/60`)
- Enhanced accent color visibility
- Proper text contrast ratios

### Animation Timing
- Quick interactions: 200-300ms
- Standard transitions: 300-500ms

## Responsive Improvements

### Mobile (< 768px)
