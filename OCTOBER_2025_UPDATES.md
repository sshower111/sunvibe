## Critical Fixes Deployed

### 1. Timezone Fix for Date Picker ‚è∞

**Commit:** 28e9c8a
**Priority:** Critical
**Status:** ‚úÖ Deployed

#### Problem
The time picker was not showing available time slots for future dates due to a timezone conversion issue:
- Using `new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]` converts dates to UTC
- When local time was past 8 PM EDT/EST, UTC time was already the next day
- System incorrectly treated tomorrow as "today", filtering out all time slots as "past"

**Example:**
- Local time: Saturday, Oct 11, 2025 at 9:26 PM EDT
- UTC time: Sunday, Oct 12, 2025 at 1:26 AM
- Bug: System thought Oct 12 was "today" and filtered all 8 AM-8 PM slots as past times

#### Solution
Replaced UTC-based date calculation with local timezone-aware version:

**File:** `app/menu/page.tsx:23-30`

```typescript
const getLocalDateString = () => {
  const now = new Date()
  const year = now.getFullYear()
  const month = String(now.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0')
  const day = String(now.getDate()).padStart(2, '0')
  return `${year}-${month}-${day}`
}
const today = getLocalDateString()
```

#### Testing
- ‚úÖ Selecting tomorrow's date now shows all available time slots
- ‚úÖ "Today" correctly identified in local timezone
- ‚úÖ Past time filtering works correctly for actual current day
- ‚úÖ Wednesday hours (8 AM - 3 PM) respected
- ‚úÖ Regular hours (8 AM - 8 PM) respected for other days

### 2. Live Stripe Keys Configuration üí≥

**Date:** October 11, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ Deployed

#### Changes Made
Switched from Stripe test mode to production/live mode:

**File:** `.env.local`

```env
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_live_[YOUR_LIVE_SECRET_KEY]"
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_live_[YOUR_LIVE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY]"
```

#### Impact
- ‚úÖ All products now fetched from Stripe live mode
- ‚úÖ Real payment processing enabled
- ‚úÖ Production tax rates applied
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Product images need to be uploaded (see Known Issues below)

---

### 3. Display Selected Pickup Time üìÖ

**Commit:** 703e10e
**Status:** ‚úÖ Deployed

#### Feature
Added display of selected pickup date and time when the picker section is collapsed.

**File:** `app/menu/page.tsx:191-195`

```typescript
{!showHoursInfo && localPickupTime === "Later" && selectedDate && (
  <div className="mt-2 text-sm md:text-base text-muted-foreground">
    Pickup: {selectedDate}{selectedTime && ` at ${selectedTime}`}
  </div>
)}
```

#### Behavior
- Shows format: "Pickup: 2025-10-12 at 10:00 AM"
- Only displays when:
  - Picker section is closed (`!showHoursInfo`)
  - "Later" option is selected
  - A date has been chosen
- Responsive text sizing (smaller on mobile)

## Known Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Product Images Not Displaying

**Status:** Requires action in Stripe Dashboard

#### Problem
Investigation revealed that product images are returning empty arrays from Stripe API:

```javascript
// Debug output:
Images array: []
Images length: 0
```

All 51 products in live mode have empty `product.images` arrays.

#### Root Cause
Images need to be in **WebP format** and properly attached to each product's `images` field in Stripe.

#### Solution Required
For each product in Stripe Dashboard (Live mode):
1. Convert product image to WebP format
2. Open product in Stripe Dashboard
3. Go to "Images" section
4. Upload the WebP image
5. Save the product

#### Technical Details
- API endpoint correctly accesses `product.images[0]`
- Fallback to `/placeholder.svg` is working as designed
- No code changes needed - images just need to be uploaded to Stripe

**File:** `app/api/products/route.ts:25`
```typescript
image: product.images[0] || '/placeholder.svg',
```

## October 12, 2025 - Pickup Time Persistence Fix

**Commit:** 2d97ceb
**Status:** ‚úÖ Deployed

### Problem
When users selected a pickup date and time on the menu page, then navigated to checkout and back to the menu, their selections would reset to default values. This created a poor user experience as customers had to re-select their pickup preferences.

### Root Cause
The local component state (`localPickupTime`, `selectedDate`, `selectedTime`) was initialized with default values and did not restore from the cart context's saved `pickupTime` on component mount. While the cart context was correctly persisting the pickup time in localStorage, the menu page UI was not reading from it on mount.

### Solution Implemented

Added a `useEffect` hook that runs once on component mount to restore the pickup time state from cart context.

**File:** `app/menu/page.tsx:66-79`

```typescript
// Restore pickup time from cart context on mount
useEffect(() => {
  if (pickupTime && pickupTime !== "ASAP") {
    // Parse the saved pickup time format: "YYYY-MM-DD at HH:MM AM/PM"
    const parts = pickupTime.split(" at ")
    if (parts.length === 2) {
      setLocalPickupTime("Later")
      setSelectedDate(parts[0])
      setSelectedTime(parts[1])
    }
  } else if (pickupTime === "ASAP") {
    setLocalPickupTime("ASAP")
  }
}, []) // Only run on mount
```

### Technical Details

**State Management Flow:**
1. Cart context stores pickup time in `localStorage` with key `"sunville-pickup-time"`
2. Format: `"YYYY-MM-DD at HH:MM AM/PM"` or `"ASAP"`
3. On menu page mount, useEffect reads `pickupTime` from cart context
4. Parses the string to restore three local state variables:
   - `localPickupTime`: "ASAP" or "Later"
   - `selectedDate`: "YYYY-MM-DD"
   - `selectedTime`: "HH:MM AM/PM"
5. UI automatically re-renders with restored selections

**Changes Made:**
- Line 64: Added `pickupTime` to cart context destructuring
- Lines 66-79: Added restoration useEffect hook

### Testing Verified

‚úÖ **Test Scenario 1: Later Pickup**
1. Select "Later" for pickup time
2. Choose date: October 12, 2025
3. Choose time: 10:30 AM
4. Add items to cart
5. Navigate to checkout
6. Navigate back to menu
7. Result: Date and time selections preserved

‚úÖ **Test Scenario 2: ASAP Pickup**
1. Select "ASAP" for pickup time
2. Add items to cart
3. Navigate to checkout
4. Navigate back to menu
5. Result: "ASAP" selection preserved

‚úÖ **Test Scenario 3: Fresh Session**
1. Clear cart / start fresh
2. Menu page shows defaults correctly
3. No errors in console

### Impact

- ‚úÖ Improved user experience
- ‚úÖ Reduced friction in checkout process
- ‚úÖ No performance impact (runs once on mount)
- ‚úÖ Backward compatible with existing cart data
- ‚úÖ Works on all devices/browsers

### Deployment

```bash
git add app/menu/page.tsx
git commit -m "Fix pickup time persistence when navigating between pages"
git push origin main
```

Vercel will automatically deploy the changes from the main branch.
