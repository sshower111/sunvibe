## Critical Fixes Deployed

### 1. Timezone Fix for Date Picker ‚è∞

**Commit:** 28e9c8a
**Priority:** Critical
**Status:** ‚úÖ Deployed

#### Problem
The time picker was not showing available time slots for future dates due to a timezone conversion issue:
- Using `new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]` converts dates to UTC
- When local time was past 8 PM EDT/EST, UTC time was already the next day
- System incorrectly treated tomorrow as "today", filtering out all time slots as "past"

**Example:**
- Local time: Saturday, Oct 11, 2025 at 9:26 PM EDT
- UTC time: Sunday, Oct 12, 2025 at 1:26 AM
- Bug: System thought Oct 12 was "today" and filtered all 8 AM-8 PM slots as past times

#### Solution
Replaced UTC-based date calculation with local timezone-aware version:

**File:** `app/menu/page.tsx:23-30`

```typescript
const getLocalDateString = () => {
  const now = new Date()
  const year = now.getFullYear()
  const month = String(now.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0')
  const day = String(now.getDate()).padStart(2, '0')
  return `${year}-${month}-${day}`
}
const today = getLocalDateString()
```

#### Testing
- ‚úÖ Selecting tomorrow's date now shows all available time slots
- ‚úÖ "Today" correctly identified in local timezone
- ‚úÖ Past time filtering works correctly for actual current day
- ‚úÖ Wednesday hours (8 AM - 3 PM) respected
- ‚úÖ Regular hours (8 AM - 8 PM) respected for other days

### 2. Live Stripe Keys Configuration üí≥

**Date:** October 11, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ Deployed

#### Changes Made
Switched from Stripe test mode to production/live mode:

**File:** `.env.local`

```env
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_live_[YOUR_LIVE_SECRET_KEY]"
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_live_[YOUR_LIVE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY]"
```

#### Impact
- ‚úÖ All products now fetched from Stripe live mode
- ‚úÖ Real payment processing enabled
- ‚úÖ Production tax rates applied
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Product images need to be uploaded (see Known Issues below)

---

### 3. Display Selected Pickup Time üìÖ

**Commit:** 703e10e
**Status:** ‚úÖ Deployed

#### Feature
Added display of selected pickup date and time when the picker section is collapsed.

**File:** `app/menu/page.tsx:191-195`

```typescript
{!showHoursInfo && localPickupTime === "Later" && selectedDate && (
  <div className="mt-2 text-sm md:text-base text-muted-foreground">
    Pickup: {selectedDate}{selectedTime && ` at ${selectedTime}`}
  </div>
)}
```

#### Behavior
- Shows format: "Pickup: 2025-10-12 at 10:00 AM"
- Only displays when:
  - Picker section is closed (`!showHoursInfo`)
  - "Later" option is selected
  - A date has been chosen
- Responsive text sizing (smaller on mobile)

---

## Known Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Product Images Not Displaying

**Status:** Requires action in Stripe Dashboard

#### Problem
Investigation revealed that product images are returning empty arrays from Stripe API:

```javascript
// Debug output:
Images array: []
Images length: 0
```

All 51 products in live mode have empty `product.images` arrays.

#### Root Cause
Images need to be in **WebP format** and properly attached to each product's `images` field in Stripe.

#### Solution Required
For each product in Stripe Dashboard (Live mode):
1. Convert product image to WebP format
2. Open product in Stripe Dashboard
3. Go to "Images" section
4. Upload the WebP image
5. Save the product

#### Technical Details
- API endpoint correctly accesses `product.images[0]`
- Fallback to `/placeholder.svg` is working as designed
- No code changes needed - images just need to be uploaded to Stripe

**File:** `app/api/products/route.ts:25`
```typescript
image: product.images[0] || '/placeholder.svg',
```

## October 12, 2025 - Pickup Time Persistence Fix

**Commit:** 2d97ceb
**Status:** ‚úÖ Deployed

### Problem
When users selected a pickup date and time on the menu page, then navigated to checkout and back to the menu, their selections would reset to default values. This created a poor user experience as customers had to re-select their pickup preferences.

### Root Cause
The local component state (`localPickupTime`, `selectedDate`, `selectedTime`) was initialized with default values and did not restore from the cart context's saved `pickupTime` on component mount. While the cart context was correctly persisting the pickup time in localStorage, the menu page UI was not reading from it on mount.

### Solution Implemented

Added a `useEffect` hook that runs once on component mount to restore the pickup time state from cart context.

**File:** `app/menu/page.tsx:66-79`

```typescript
// Restore pickup time from cart context on mount
useEffect(() => {
  if (pickupTime && pickupTime !== "ASAP") {
    // Parse the saved pickup time format: "YYYY-MM-DD at HH:MM AM/PM"
    const parts = pickupTime.split(" at ")
    if (parts.length === 2) {
      setLocalPickupTime("Later")
      setSelectedDate(parts[0])
      setSelectedTime(parts[1])
    }
  } else if (pickupTime === "ASAP") {
    setLocalPickupTime("ASAP")
  }
}, []) // Only run on mount
```

### Technical Details

**State Management Flow:**
1. Cart context stores pickup time in `localStorage` with key `"sunville-pickup-time"`
2. Format: `"YYYY-MM-DD at HH:MM AM/PM"` or `"ASAP"`
3. On menu page mount, useEffect reads `pickupTime` from cart context
4. Parses the string to restore three local state variables:
   - `localPickupTime`: "ASAP" or "Later"
   - `selectedDate`: "YYYY-MM-DD"
   - `selectedTime`: "HH:MM AM/PM"
5. UI automatically re-renders with restored selections

**Changes Made:**
- Line 64: Added `pickupTime` to cart context destructuring
- Lines 66-79: Added restoration useEffect hook

### Testing Verified

‚úÖ **Test Scenario 1: Later Pickup**
1. Select "Later" for pickup time
2. Choose date: October 12, 2025
3. Choose time: 10:30 AM
4. Add items to cart
5. Navigate to checkout
6. Navigate back to menu
7. Result: Date and time selections preserved

‚úÖ **Test Scenario 2: ASAP Pickup**
1. Select "ASAP" for pickup time
2. Add items to cart
3. Navigate to checkout
4. Navigate back to menu
5. Result: "ASAP" selection preserved

‚úÖ **Test Scenario 3: Fresh Session**
1. Clear cart / start fresh
2. Menu page shows defaults correctly
3. No errors in console

### Impact

- ‚úÖ Improved user experience
- ‚úÖ Reduced friction in checkout process
- ‚úÖ No performance impact (runs once on mount)
- ‚úÖ Backward compatible with existing cart data
- ‚úÖ Works on all devices/browsers

### Deployment

```bash
git add app/menu/page.tsx
git commit -m "Fix pickup time persistence when navigating between pages"
git push origin main
```

Vercel will automatically deploy the changes from the main branch.

## October 24, 2025 - Contact Page & Chatbot Improvements

**Commit:** c8b68a4
**Status:** ‚úÖ Deployed

### Contact Page Cleanup

Simplified the contact page by removing redundant contact information cards and eliminating empty space.

#### Changes Made

**Removed Contact Information Cards:**
- "Visit Us" card displaying address (4053 Spring Mountain Rd, Las Vegas, NV 89102)
- "Call Us" card displaying phone number (702-889-8897)
- These details were redundant as customers can submit inquiries through the contact form

**Layout Improvements:**
- Removed `mt-16` spacing that created large gap below contact form
- Contact page now focuses solely on the message submission form
- Cleaner, more streamlined user experience

**File Modified:** `app/contact/page.tsx`
- Removed lines 242-264 containing the contact info grid
- Maintained form functionality and validation

### Chatbot Positioning Fix

Fixed the Chatbase greeting message to appear on the right side with the chatbot button for consistent positioning.

#### Problem
The chatbot button appeared on the right side of the screen, but the greeting message "Hi there, welcome to Sunville Bakery, how are you today?" appeared on the left side, creating a confusing user experience.

#### Solution Implemented

**File Modified:** `app/globals.css`

Updated CSS positioning rules for Chatbase widget elements:

```css
/* Chatbase widget positioning */
#chatbase-bubble-button {
  right: 20px !important;
  left: auto !important;
}

#chatbase-bubble-window {
  right: 20px !important;
  left: auto !important;
}

#chatbase-bubble-prompt {
  right: 90px !important;  /* Changed from 20px */
  left: auto !important;
}

.chatbase-bubble-prompt {
  right: 90px !important;  /* Changed from 20px */
  left: auto !important;
}

/* Additional selectors for greeting message */
[class*="chatbase"][class*="prompt"] {
  right: 90px !important;
  left: auto !important;
}

iframe[id*="chatbase"] + div,
div[class*="chatbase-greeting"],
div[style*="position"][style*="fixed"]:has(> div:first-child:only-child) {
  right: 90px !important;
  left: auto !important;
}
```

#### Technical Details

**Positioning Strategy:**
- Chatbot button: `right: 20px` (remains at far right)
- Greeting prompt: `right: 90px` (positioned to the left of button)
- Both elements now aligned on the right side of the screen

**CSS Selectors Added:**
- Multiple attribute selectors to catch various Chatbase class names
- Covered different potential DOM structures used by Chatbase widget
- Used `!important` to override inline styles from Chatbase script

#### Visual Impact

- ‚úÖ Greeting message now appears on right side
- ‚úÖ Positioned just to the left of the chatbot button
- ‚úÖ Consistent right-side alignment for all chatbot elements
- ‚úÖ Professional, cohesive appearance

### Testing Verified

‚úÖ **Contact Page:**
- Contact form displays correctly
- No visual gaps or empty space below form
- Form validation and submission working
- Responsive design maintained

‚úÖ **Chatbot:**
- Greeting message appears on right side
- Chatbot button remains on right side
- Both elements properly aligned
- No overlap or positioning conflicts

### Deployment

```bash
git add app/contact/page.tsx app/globals.css
git commit -m "Remove contact info cards and fix chatbot greeting position"
git push origin main
```

Vercel automatically deployed from the main branch.

### Impact

**User Experience Improvements:**
- Cleaner contact page focused on message submission
